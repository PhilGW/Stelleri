When Django accepts an HTTP request, it consults the root URLconf to lookup a view function,
and then calls the view function to handle the request.
Similarly, when Channels accepts a WebSocket connection, it consults the root routing configuration to
lookup a consumer, and then calls various functions on the consumer to handle events from the connection.
We will write a basic consumer that accepts WebSocket connections on the path /ws/chat/ROOM_NAME/
that takes any message it receives on the WebSocket and echos it back to the same WebSocket.

It is good practice to use a common path prefix like /ws/ to distinguish WebSocket connections from ordinary HTTP connections

NOTES ON DOCKER from startup tutorial:
docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
You'll notice a few flags being used. Here's some more info on them:
    -d - run the container in detached mode (in the background)
    -p 80:80 - map port 80 of the host to port 80 in the container
    docker/getting-started - the image to use
